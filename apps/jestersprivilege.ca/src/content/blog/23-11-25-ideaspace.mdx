**Narrator**
Are you lost?

**Traveller**
No, I am reading this website.

**Narrator**
You know where you are, in the real world, but what about Ideaspace?

**Traveller**
Ideaspace?

# Ideaspace

## noun.

> Ideaspace is a mathematical model used to describe the mind in a manner congruent with modern physics

**Narrator** What did you have for breakfast? Was it the same toast as the day before, or maybe you tried something new like a salmon bagel? Naturally toast and bagels are close together in ideaspace: probably right next to eachother. But salmon bagels are further out for sure, but near the same heading.

**Traveller**
I guess now I'm lost and bored.

**Narrator**
Please, allow me to explain. A metric space is defined in math as:

> A metric is a function that defines the distance between two points.
>
> 1.  Non-negativity: distances are ≥ 0
> 2.  Identity: distance is 0 only if the points are identical
> 3.  Symmetry: distance(a, b) = distance(b, a)
> 4.  Triangle inequality: going straight is shortest → d(a, c) ≤ d(a, b) + d(b, c)

But we're not dealing with **POINTS** we're dealing with **IDEAS**.

Imagine ideas as being points on a plane:

**Triangle Inequality**: You can’t create shortcuts by zig-zagging; the metric has to reflect that the straight comparison between two ideas is always the most efficient route.

**Traveller**
So these rules are like the laws of physics, but for a universe of ideas?

**Narrator**
Yes, just like how the laws of physics shape our physical world, these rules shape the world of ideas. Here's a practical example.

# Triangle Inequality

## General Relativity

**Narrator** Before 1907, Einstein understood gravity the same way everyone else did: Newton’s force that pulls objects together across space.

<div class="my-6 flex flex-col md:flex-row md:items-start md:gap-4">
  <div class="mb-4 flex-shrink-0 md:mb-0 md:w-[220px]">
    <img
      src="/a-b-c.png"
      alt="A diagram showing the distance between idea A to B to C is a longer distance than idea A to C"
      class="mx-auto max-w-[200px] w-full"
    />
  </div>
  <div class="flex-1">
Einstein recalls this as "the happiest thought of my life".

> A person in free fall feels no gravity.
> That's indistinguishable from being weightless in deep space.

      - **A:** Everyday intuition about gravity
      - **B:** The Equivalence Principle
      - **C:** Gravity as curvature of spacetime (General Relativity)

  </div>
</div>

The insight that gravity and acceleration are equivalent bridged old and new thinking. Gravity wasn’t a force, but simply the shape of spacetime.

**Traveller**
Your analogy is breaking apart, it's obvious that A to C is the fastest route

**Narrator**
It is not about going faster, it is about navigation. Einstein knew which direction to go but had to discover The Equivalence Principle before
discovering his destination: a curved spacetime.

**Traveller**
So C did not exist before?

**Narrator**
It's more accurate to say that Einstein had to uncover the idea of curved spacetime, rather than simply aim for it from the start.

<div class="my-6 flex flex-col md:flex-row md:items-start md:gap-4">
  <div class="mb-4 flex-1 md:mb-0">
When you're truly on the edge of ideaspace whether it be at work or in life, it can feel like a grey cloud is blocking your way. You generally
know which direction to go but the destination is unclear. This can feel upsetting, tense, anxious and depressing.

Great things are behind the cloud but it's a fools errand to try and leap over or through the cloud. Remember, you're navigating and not
travelling.

## The Lost Woods

**Narrator**
In the Lost Woods from Zelda, every screen has four possible directions, but only one moves you closer to where you want to go.

![Lost woods zelda](/lost-woods.png)

When you are given this puzzle you begin by going in each cardinal direction at random. This is navigating ideaspace without a reliable metric.
You can’t tell how close you are to the exit because every wrong turn loops you back to the start.

Eventually the player notices pattern in the environment, subtle changes in the trees, maybe one is missing. Once you begin recording this, you feel a
sense of direction. You do not know where the destination is but you know you are making progress.

**Traveller**
So metrics are really important, huh?

**Narrator**
Yes, and equally so is picking the right ones. If you just listened for changes in the music, counted the pixels in the Link's sword or tried to notice
other unrelated details, the player would have only won through dumb luck.

# A Compass for Ideaspace

**Traveller**
So let's say I'm lost. How do I pick a direction?

## Gradient Descent

> An iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function by taking steps in the direction of the steepest descent.

![Gradient descent](/gradient-descent.webp)

**Narrator**
Imagine you are a truffle pig. Mother nature has given you a powerful snout and mankind has given you a mandate to make hamburgers $30 with one condiment.
Truffles are underground and their smell is really faint. But if you train your nose it's just a matter of "going in the right direction". If done well,
it should feel more like exploring and discovering than simply following instructions. Taking little steps and boring small holes until you find what you
didn't even know you were looking for.
