My first attempt at building a high-end piece of furniture.

    ### The only lumber yard in YYT

    I began with some Walnut
    Lumber I purchased from **Provincial Wood Products** in town. I don't have a
    planer or jointer but chose rough boards and they charged $60 to mill it
    for me.

I used [CutList Optimizer](https://www.cutlistoptimizer.com/) to plan the cuts:

Learning moment, I wish I had:

- More closely matched the grain around the board
- Was more careful copying the pattern and had a better way of doing that
- Avoided knots somehow, but the software doesn't do that...

## First cuts!

This was super nerve-wracking. Every cut I was holding my breath because this wood is
pricey. But after the first few rips were done, I built a cross-cutting jig and it got
a lot more accurate then on.

## Gotta work with what you got

_October 20th_

This mistake / limitation cost me a good 3 weekend days of glueing, patching and fixing. But if I had a bigger table saw, it would have been less than a day and much more accurate.

    ### My hand-me-down tablesaw is small

    The instructions say to glue the boards length-wise as shown and THEN make your horizontal width cuts at a 45, but I don't have a very big table saw.

    I had to cut each of these pieces INDIVIDUALLY then at a 45.

    ### It took me days.

    But if I was doing this for a nice end table, I would have went to Osmond's and saved time and money.

## Glue is stronger than wood

I could have left the boards at the length they were given to me, but glue is stronger than wood and the instructions used a different width of lumber so I wanted to follow.

      alt: "It turned out okay. As I said, I don't have a jointer which would have really helped making these edges nicer. I also didn't have a hand plane at this point. That said, the other side was MUCH better so I just used that. I have a picture of this side because it was the worst of all of them for glue marks.",

## My beautiful legs

The legs were the trickiest part and I royally screwed up one of them, but I just used it for the back and nobody has noticed.

    ### JIT: Jig in time?

    I threw this jig together in ~30 mins. I lined up my cut lines from the bottom then clamped them.

    It worked really well. It's not very fast but this completely replaces my need for a miter saw and it actually does more.

    It's very safe, too. There's a rail on the bottom made of hardwood this time.

### Much cleaner joints this time

Because the tapering jig was well built the joints came out much nicer.
