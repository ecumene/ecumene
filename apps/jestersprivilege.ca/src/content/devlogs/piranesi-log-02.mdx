# Gameplay

For this to be a survival game, the player needs to feel like they are surviving against all odds. The player is human,
and mortal, so it's important from a realism perspective that they have some way to eat.

## The Player and the Heron

I coded these Herons to sit around unless startled or bored. I also made these spears that you can pick up and chuck
at them. When they're hit with the spear, they have a simple falling and death animation.

## Starting from an image

This is the first time I've modeled a bird from an image like this. Since birds are symmetrical, you can model one
side of them and mirror it to the other.

Then, I made animations for:

 - Sitting _(Idling)_
 - Idle 1 _(Flapping its wings)_
 - Idle 2 _(Looking around)_
 - Idle 3 _(Scratching under its wing)_
 - Flying
 - Falling
 - Dying _(Hitting the ground)_

## Next Steps...

I'm going to implement a really simple hunger system next. You should be able to starve to death, and be able to eat the
food you have ([raw and wrrrigggling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOF6iqHYksU)). I also want there to be a really
simple fishing mechanic - but you would have to go really low to find them which is dangerous.
