# Piranesi

My (soon to be) brother-in-law lent me a book he loved called Piranesi.

## Labyrinths

It's about a man "trapped" in a labyrinth. The man refers to it as **the House**, which itself
contains halls upon halls of statues where no two are the same except in a mysterious room.

## Forbidden Knowledge

The the main character (Piranesi) believes himself to be a scientist discovering its wonders for
another captive named **the Other**.

## The Tide

There are no monsters, there are no other people (except **the Other**), there is just Piranesi,
their journal, and the **House**. But there is danger: a rising and falling tide that floods the
halls with water and fish to eat.

# A video game

I want to build this as a video game during the break. I love mystery in video games: Metroid Prime
was a big part of my childhood. I would make arm-blasters out of knex and run around.

What I love about Metroid Prime is how it puts you in a strange, ancient world and makes you feel like
an explorer solving puzzles.

Games like Halo, The Legend of Zelda, Minecraft, Lethal Company, Hollow Knight, and [Metroid Prime 4:
Beyond](https://www.galaxus.be/en/page/metroid-prime-4-beyond-preview-nintendos-finally-won-me-over-40400) aren’t just fun because of their mechanics or action - they’re fun because their worlds are mysterious,
immersive, and make you feel like you’re discovering something unknown.

But it is the worldbuilding—the atmosphere, the details, the sense of a vast mysterious place—that transforms it into something unforgettable. The environment makes the game great and turns simple mechanics into a truly memorable adventure."

## Gameplay

### The labyrinth

Imagine a game you can play with your friends: Exploring a vast never-ending labyrinth of statues.

On the left, a horizontal plan view shows an oval staircase at the center with West Wing, East Wing, and North Wing extending outward indefinitely, labeled “Horizontal = Infinite.” A small box beneath the staircase is labeled “the Other.” On the right, a vertical cross-section shows the staircase as a stacked cylindrical structure with winding stairs. The upper level is capped with clouds and sunlight, the middle level aligns with a fluctuating blue tide line annotated “the tide is unpredictable, but it brings food and water,” and the lower level is submerged in water marked “Danger.” The bottom caption reads “Vertical = Finite,” emphasizing infinite horizontal expansion and limited vertical range."

### The Other

**The Other** seen behind the door, develops your photos and gives you more disposable cameras.
You do not know his motivation and you assume him to be a captive in this world just the same as
you are.

### The Halls

**The House** has effectively infinite halls: you don't need to search every crevice but the more
photos you take of statues the more cameras and gear **the Other** will give you.

### Journals

Throughout the halls you'll find journals scattered at random. These give you backstory on the main
character and help you map out areas you haven't explored before.

#### The Round Tower

> [ **Carceri d'invenzione** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carceri_d%27invenzione), often translated as **Imaginary Prisons**, is a series of 16 etchings by the Italian artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi.

I want to take a lot of inspiration from 18th century etchings like this because I think they ooze
mystery. Something about the scale and the never ending walls make for a hypnotizing setting.

### Multiplayer

I have never programmed a multiplayer game through Steamworks before but it's proving to be fairly
challenging. I have programmed some simple multiplayer before in my own engine but never anything
this complex. It's intimidating and frankly I'm scared shitless. I might drop the multiplayer aspect
and keep it simple.
