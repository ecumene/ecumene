## I coach for Get Coding

[Get Coding](get-coding.ca) is not a bootcamp. I don't really like the
bootcamp style of teaching because people get left behind. Instead Get Coding
is a 1-on-1 system where a student is paired with a coach for a module (such as
HTML / CSS / JavaScript), in which the goal is to produce a fleshed out project
by the end and then the student moves on to a new coach. This networks students
with coaches around the city and gives them diverse experience. It ends up
being better value than a bootcamp, because coaches have jobs outside of the
dojo.

Nobody is salaried and that makes the program a great value for the
students and a great value for the coaches who get a hiring pool of potential
references. I highly recommend it to aspiring students and coaches.

## Habits are important

It takes a lot of soft-skills to be a good developer. I make that clear during
my sessions with students. However there is one soft-skill that can make the
difference between a hirable and not-so hirable developer and that's their
ability to form good habits. A little bit of work every day snowballs into
results that are desirable to talent managers. Whether that be reading every
night before bed or committing every day (stay with me I'm getting there).

## 游릴 Green Square's aren't everything

As much as I loove 游릴游릴游릴 **I don't** think the sole reason some people get
hired is because of their contribution graph. I think it could be a good
indicator of grit. For example if someone has a consistent graph with little
spikes here and there, they're more likely to stand out because of their
habits. There are many other factors hiring managers look for like followers,
location, language, and repository stats but if you're looking for something
to add on top of all of that a nice green chart is good to have.

## Trainstop

I made Trainstop to motivate my students a little more by giving them a
currency whenever they completed a full week of committing. They can cash in
that money on the same website for gift cards for coffee or food. The majority
of my students immediately jumped on this and so did coaches.

If you miss a day you can still keep committing, because it isn't the days that
are counted it's the streak. You can commit from Wednesday-Wednesday or Sunday-
Sunday. It all gets counted the same.

## How it works

I hate hosting things. I hate maintaining things when they go down and exposing
myself and others to risks when they use my stuff. Instead I statically
generate wherever I can and use minimal Javascript. This frees so much hassle
with any project if you can get away with it.

Student contributions are counted from the start of the year. If you have a
streak of 7 days in a row, you get a MitchBuck! This can be used to cash in
[at the MitchShop](https://trainstop.mitchellhynes.com/shop) for lots of stuff.
To spend this, you must trigger a new website build via the `config.toml`:

```toml
[[buy]]
username = "urgithubusername"
deducted = 4
for = "timmies10"
```

The site is also rebuilt daily via Github Actions so I don't need to update it
at all. Building the site daily and when you buy something means that the site
is completely portable. If you wanted to host this somewhere, it would just need

- [x] A CD System
- [x] A way to host static files
- [x] A way for users to modify the code

In fact forking the project is enough to make your own Trainstop for your
own students. Just don't forget to merge any fixes upstream please ;)

The frontend is written in Svelte, a framework not too dissimilar from React,
except the work React would normally do on the client side is baked into the
app including data if you'd like. Since I use Github data, using a token or
setting up an API would be costly, so I do that during the build step and bake
user data into the HTML. When the Javascript loads, the only next step is to
bootstrap Svelte and it's very fast.

![A diagram of how Trainstop gets built. It starts with a list of users (T.O.M.L.) then gets passed to a deno script that gets a response from github. Then that github data gets fed to Svelte (the frontend build process) through a list of users, which finally gets baked into an H.T.M.L. cake for the frontend to consume.](/blog-assets/trainstop2.png)

**Svelte** is comparable to SSR except you can change what's on the page after it
has loaded. You might say that's a lot like Next.js/Remix and you'd be right!
But Svelte separates itself from React on the server by compiling its
components to HTML before it even leaves the server. React based tools have to
do a lot of logic to get to a final state where it can commit to the DOM. This
makes it somewhat superior in situations where the content does not really
change from user to user.

**Deno** grabs the user data during build. I'm a Deno sceptic, but in this case it
served me well and I would use it again for something similar. Deno excels in
one-off scripts. The fact that you can have a `.ts` file and not have to `npm i`
is really liberating. It makes Javascript feel like a real programming
language with a `std` library and everything! I'm not sure about using Deno as
the base for a real-life "production" application but for little things like
this it is nice.

**Tailwind** is also a project I was not keen on using in the beginning, but I
really tried to humble myself here. Tailwind gives you opinionated CSS
defaults. These are in the form of classnames for everything you could think of
from `.justify-center` to `.w-100`. This is megabytes of CSS, but their tools
only generate what you need so when you ship code it's nice and small. If I was
using this in real life, I would use it along with some kind of atomic CSS so
like classnames are grouped together. I wasn't eager to use it because I'm
pretty good at CSS. However Tailwind does make you faster not just because you
don't have to write styles, but also because you don't go down rabbit holes
of variables, breakpoints, animations... It has defaults for those out of the
box so there's no chance of you (or your colleague) thinking of making any
creative selectors using general/adjacent sibling (you should be _ashamed_.)

## Conclusion

Trainstop was a fun project to build, and in the few months it's been in use
it's motivated some of my students to get into good habits like working on
something every day. The project is also very easy to host yourself and I
encourage others to do so.
